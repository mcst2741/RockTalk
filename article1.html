                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Like many Coloradans, I have marveled at the Rocky Mountains every chance I can get. However, I have always wondered how their majestic peaks came to be.
                        You can imagine my surprise when I found out that the origins of these mountains are not only a mystery, but that the region they occupy started out underwater
                        as well! As soon as I learned about this, I was hooked. I have completed several assignments for my geology class about this topic but that still is not enough.
                        I needed to know how exactly the Rocky Mountains formed, and I am sure you are all interested in their origin story as well now. To preface, I think the origin story
                        of the Rocky Mountains is best told split up into four chapters: the first set of the Rocky Mountains, when Colorado was submerged underwater, the actual uplift,
                        and the downfall of them. So, how exactly did the Rocky Mountains form?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, the story of how the Rocky Mountains came to exist has puzzled geologists for many years. You see, the Rockies are a beautiful, yet confusing anomaly. These
                        continental, landlocked mountains did not form like their Himalayan and Appalachian counterparts. To start, the Rocky Mountains are not near an active tectonic plate
                        boundary, they are not even near an intra-plate boundary. To create continental mountains, the area needs to have two active tectonic plates colliding into each other.
                        Secondly, the Rocky Mountains are not rooted in the crust. Collisional mountains typically form a &quot;root&quot; in the crust beneath them during a tectonic collision event.
                        When the plates collide, the crust gets smashed together, lifting it up. Since the crust is forced upwards, it causes the crust to become shorter horizontally. This
                        process of vertical crustal thickening and horizontal shortening creates a mountain root which helps keep the mountain stable in the crust. Finally, the surrounding
                        terrain does not match what it should be for collisional mountains. For example, the Colorado Plateau lacks geologic structures, like faults and folds, which prove
                        the region was a byproduct of collisional forces despite it being above sea level (Abbott<sup>1</sup>). With all these anomalies involving the origin of the Rocky Mountains and
                        its surrounding regions, let us dive into the anticipated origin of the mountains and the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The area where the Rocky Mountains currently reside has a rich geological history. Before we had the gorgeous Rocky Mountains, there were the Ancestral Rocky Mountains
                        around 300 million years ago during the Paleozoic Era (“Geologic Time Scale”<sup>2</sup>). These mountains were essentially islands that originated from a tropical ocean when Colorado
                        was close to the equator. After about 150 million years, these mountains were weathered down to sea level. After another 50 million years, the sedimentary remains of the
                        Ancestral Rocky Mountains and Colorado were submerged by a sea (Abbott<sup>1</sup>). This sea is known as the Western Interior Seaway which connected the Arctic Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.
                        During this time, Colorado was below sea level because it was weighed down by the sea and sediment being continuously deposited and compacted there. Once the sea receded at the
                        end of the Cretaceous Period, around 70 million years ago, the Rocky Mountains began to form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The initial Rocky Mountain building event is thought to have occurred between 70 million to 45 million years ago in the Mesozoic era at the end of the Cretaceous period. This building
                        event is called the Laramide Orogeny (“Geologic Time Scale”<sup>2</sup>). This orogeny began due to the oceanic Pacific plate subducting, going under, the continental North American plate. This subduction
                        event is thought to have occurred at a very shallow angle which generated a lot of compressional energy and stress. Said energy traveled far inland to where the present Rocky Mountains are today (HISTORY<sup>4</sup>).
                        This type of energy causes rocks to squeeze together and can lead them to fold and buckle upwards. This not only formed the Rockies, but also created features that one would see at collisional mountains
                        even though two plates did not collide during this orogeny. For example, there are thrust faults present at many of the bases of the mountains that make up the Rockies (Abbott<sup>1</sup>). These faults occur from
                        compressional stresses which cause one slab of rock to be pushed up over another slab. After the region faced the compressional stresses and uplifted, a series of events caused many of the mountains to
                        be eroded and buried. Mechanical weathering processes like rivers and frost wedging ate away at the mountains and deposited the sediments elsewhere. However, volcanism from the surrounding region, like
                        the La Garita Caldera, caused pyroclastic debris to settle and bury some of the mountains (Abbott<sup>1</sup>). These two processes caused the mountains to lose a substantial amount of height, which leads to some
                        debated theories about how we even have the present-day Rocky Mountains.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now here is where the drama begins, it is a hotly debated topic whether the Rockies faced a second orogeny or not. Their original uplift can be explained by the shallow subduction, but their lack of a crustal
                        root and their other above sea level features cannot be explained by that. Some geologists theorize that a second orogeny occurred due to the mantle being unexpectedly warmer than normal. Increased heat in the
                        mantle would cause the rocks to expand and uplift the overlying crust. The theorized uplift where the mantle was warmed is called the Alvarado Ridge. The mountains that survived from the previous erosive and
                        burial processes are thought to be on top of this ridge. This is why the Rocky Mountains in Colorado are taller than the rest in the mountain chain. Additionally, this second orogeny could explain other features
                        in the area. This could be the reason the Colorado Plateau and Great Plains are elevated above sea level as well as the abundance of hot springs in the area. The only issue with this theory is when it happened.
                        With the mantle being warmer, it could have triggered some of the volcanism that buried some of the Rockies to begin with. However, this would mean that the origin of the Alvarado Ridge and the eruption of La Garita
                        Caldera would have happened within a very short span of geological time. Geologists estimate that the mantle warming up and the second orogeny would have occurred anywhere from 38 million years ago to 24 million years ago
                        (Abbott<sup>1</sup>). If this is the reason the Rocky Mountains do not have a crustal root, then it is assumed that they are only stable due to the thick crust being more buoyant than the hot mantle underneath it
                        (&quot;Geology of Rocky Mountain National Park&quot;<sup>3</sup>).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If this second orogeny did occur, then more erosive processes would have to take place to produce the beautiful geography we know and love today. One of the most notable erosion processes being glaciers. See, glaciers are
                        powerful enough to turn rolling hills into U-shaped valleys and jagged cliffs. They can also carry sediment, both enormous and small particulates, across vast distances. Nearby regions often contain boulders and sediments
                        from the Rocky Mountains due to erosion from the glaciers (HISTORY<sup>4</sup>). As mentioned before, glaciers helped form features like U-shaped valleys, but they also formed lateral moraines and caused striations on the surface
                        rocks in the region.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Well, there is the story of how the Rocky Mountains came to be, or at least one of the more accepted stories by geologists. Since these mountains formed in such anomalous circumstances, their exact origin is difficult to pinpoint.
                        However, studying them has led to invaluable information about plate tectonics and mountain building orogenies. If new theories were not being crafted and tested, then we would still have no idea how to solve the mystery of the Rocky
                        Mountains. Now, you all understand the theories and explanations behind how the Rocky Mountains and their surrounding region was formed.
